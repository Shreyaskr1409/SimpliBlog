### Introduction

This reposotory is a personal project of mine but I also want this to work out in the grand scheme of things as I really think blog-based learning is lacking in university students and learners in India. Blogs bring out the reality of working in an industry.

### Status of the repository

Currently I am working alone on this project but I really appreciate contributions which could vastly solve issues regarding the website. As of today (31 July 2024), I am actively working on making this website work out. I have to see how far this project goes.

This repository is divided into 2 sections, Backend and Frontend. Currently Frontend is present inside the backend folder only as `/frontend` which has `/web` and `/mobile` but I wish to separate both of these in near future to make it easy for me to continuously work on it.

### To Start Contributing

Follow the given steps to start contributing (TO THE BACKEND):

- STEP 1: Clone this github repository.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Shreyaskr1409/SimpliBlog.git
```

- STEP 2: Open the directory where you cloned the repository. Depending on which code you want to run/edit, client-side or server-side, Stay in root directory for server-side backend, frontend/web directory for client-side website, frontend/mobile directory for client-side mobile app,

```bash
cd SimpliBlog
```

> For `/` (backend) or `/frontend/web` (website)

- STEP 3: Run the following command to install all the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

- STEP 4: Run the following command to run the app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Prefer using Simpliblog API once the server-side programs are deployed. Till then, you can personally contact me with my contacts given at the end of this README.md

> The android app will be started to be worked on later on. So, `/frontend/mobile` for now will stay empty

### API reference
API Reference will be given in API_REFERENCE.md really soon

### THANK YOU FOR VISITING!
