# USER PAGE

### For the settings

- fix share user
- fix notifications (only for logged in users)
- report user function implementation (in both backend and frontend)
- think about how to deal with invite users
- link github repo
- make link helpdesk
- make support me page

### ~For images~

- ~~implement avatar CRUD~~
- ~~implement Blog images showing~~
- ~implement blog images carousel~

### For code

- see why TS is creating such a huge mess with those squiggly red lines
- resolve the variable management in a cleaner way
- sameuser and loggedinconfirm from topbar and +page of user should be merged into a single variable
- remove get user like api calls from editinfosheet and just use the available data from stores to fill the required data
- make sure the images are removed from cloudinary as the avatar is altered

### QUICK!

- Make the backend changes for showing the images in the blog posts. Do the regex and get it done quickly.
- Add functionality to preview code and add basic informations for how to write markdown
